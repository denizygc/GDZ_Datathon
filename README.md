# GDZ_Datathon

Gdz Elektrik, which delivers electrical energy, which is indispensable for daily life in Izmir and Manisa provinces, to its consumers with its people-oriented service approach and modern technology systems, is launching the second of its traditional Datathon series. 🏙

Expectation:
Participants are expected to develop an "energy distribution" forecasting approach for the network centers under the responsibility of Gdz Elektrik with the data set presented. 🎯

Description-1
Any data that is thought to be related to the variable in the dataset and that can be used externally to add factors that will affect the energy distributed is available to us. However, we stated at the opening that we left space for the contestants as we cannot open every data for external use due to company policy. We have the realization data to evaluate the predictions made by the contestants.

Explanation-2
At the end of the competition, the notebooks of the first 30 teams will be requested. Criteria such as the external data used by the teams, the features produced, whether alternative solution methods were used will be evaluated.
